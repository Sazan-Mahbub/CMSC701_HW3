# CMSC701_HW3
CMSC701 Homework 3 : Evaluating two different AMQs

Since this homework included a lot of empirical evaluations, 

### Task 1 — Empirical evaluation of the bloom filter
Command to run experiments of Task 1:
> python Homework3-task1.py
##### Alternatively:
> Run the jupyter-notebook named "Homework3-task1.ipynb" in the given order (i.e., run-all option).

The results (plots) will be generated in a new folder named "results_task1/"

As additional analyses, I have also plotted the change of total number of set-bits and the total number of words (bytes) of the bloomfilter with respect to the size of the input dataset and the target false positive rate.

### Task 2 — Empirical evaluation of a minimal perfect hash
Command to run experiments of Task 2:
> python Homework3-task2.py
##### Alternatively:
> Run the jupyter-notebook named "Homework3-task2.ipynb" in the given order (i.e., run-all option).

The results (plots) will be generated in a new folder named "results_task2/"


### Task 3 — Augment the MPHF with a “fingerprint array”
Command to run experiments of Task 3:
> python Homework3-task3.py
##### Alternatively:
> Run the jupyter-notebook named "Homework3-task3.ipynb" in the given order (i.e., run-all option).

The results (plots) will be generated in a new folder named "results_task3/"
