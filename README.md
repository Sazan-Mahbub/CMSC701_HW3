CMSC701 Homework 3 : Evaluating two different AMQs

Since this homework included a lot of empirical evaluations, 

### Task 1 — Empirical evaluation of the bloom filter
Command to run experiments of Task 1:
> python Homework3-task1.py

The results (plots) will be generated in a new folder named "results_task1/"

As additional analyses, I have also plotted the change of total number of set-bits and the total number of words (bytes) of the bloomfilter with respect to the size of the input dataset and the target false positive rate.
